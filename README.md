# THREE.js Tutorial: Scroll Animation

## Smooth animation triggered by scrolling.

A simple Three.js application that loads an OBJ model, adds a matcap material, and includes a scroll-based animation. Also includes a starfield background, and a gradient sprite layer.

### Customization

- **OBJ Model**: Replace `astronaut.obj` with any other OBJ model to customize the scene.
- **Textures**: Change the texture applied to the model by modifying the image used in the `TextureLoader`.
- **Starfield**: Adjust the number of stars and other parameters in `getStarfield.js` for different visual effects.
- **Scroll Animation**: Modify the scroll behavior by adjusting the `goalPos` and `rate` variables in the `animate` function.
